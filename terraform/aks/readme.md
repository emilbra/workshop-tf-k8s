# About AKS

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is the Kubernetes Platform we will be running our application on.
This is just one of many options for hosting Kubernetes, and the workflow will be similar on plattforms provided by other providers.

For this practical workshop, Sopra Steria has set up the AKS platform allready.
This is a resource that takes some time to provision. You can review the Terraform code in this folder, but you wont deploy this to Azure.
